Matching Open And Close Tags</h2>\n\n<p>\nElements of HTML has an interesting property: the name of an opening tag has to match the name of a closing tag. \nThough natural for humans, this is, surprisingly, rather difficult task from the parsing theory point of view.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnfortunately, standard solutions do not really work as we would like to.\nWe describe problem in more details in the supplementary <a href=\"../matchingTags.html\">Matching Tags</a> chapter.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo fix the issue, PetitParser2 comes with a special syntax to express constrains of matching open and close tags.\nIt can store a result of a rule (e.g. opening an html tag) onto a stack using the <code>push</code> operator and assert that a result of a rule (e.g. closing an html tag) matches the top of the stack using the <code>match</code> operator.\n</p>\n<p>\nHere is the concrete example:\nFirst we define an element name as a repetition of letters and digits:\n</p>\n<pre>MessageNotUnderstood: receiver of &quot;new&quot; is nil</pre>\n<p>\nThan we define element as a sequence of <code>elOpen</code>, <code>elContent</code> and <code>elClose</code>:\n</p>\n\n<figure><pre><code class=\"smalltalk\">WebGrammar&gt;&gt;element\n\t^ (elOpen, elContent, elClose)</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>\nIn <code>elOpen</code>, we push the element name as well as we consume water in case an element contains arguments:\n</p>\n<pre>MessageNotUnderstood: receiver of &quot;new&quot; is nil</pre>\n<p>\nIn <code>elClose</code>, we first match the element name against the top of a stack and we pop the stack in case of success:\n</p>\n<pre>MessageNotUnderstood: receiver of &quot;new&quot; is nil</pre>\n</section><section>\n<h2>2. Element Content</h2>\n<p>\nNow we need to define <code>elContent</code> rule, which represents the content of an element. \n<code>elContent</code> is zero or more repetitions of the following components in the given order: \n</p><ol><li>a javascript code; </li>\n<li>another element; or </li>\n<li>an unknown text. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nJavascript is on the first position because it is <em>kind of</em> an element and therefore must be ordered before element. \nThe same holds for an element, it is also <em>kind of</em> text. \n</p>\n<pre>MessageNotUnderstood: receiver of &quot;new&quot; is nil</pre>\n\n<p>\nText can be anything.\nTherefore, we define it as with the help of bounded seas:\n</p>\n<figure><pre><code class=\"smalltalk\">WebGrammar&gt;&gt;text\n\t^ #any starLazy</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<section>\n<h3>Epsilon in Repetitions</h3>\n<p>\nNote, we mark text as <code>nonEpsilon</code>.\n<code>nonEpsilon</code> operator is an extension of PEGs that allows only for non-empty parses. \nThe reason for this is that <code>#any asPParser starLazy</code> can consume anything, even the empty string. \nThe star repetition of <code>elContent</code> would end up in an infinite loop recognizing an epsilon in each of its iterations, never failing, never stopping.\n</p>\n</section></section><section>\n<h2>3. Testing the Code</h2>\n<p>\nWe have written a new code, let us try if it works. \nWe start with <code>text</code>:\n</p>\n\n<pre>MessageNotUnderstood: receiver of &quot;new&quot; is nil</pre>\n\n<p>\nAnd <code>element</code> follows:\n</p>\n<pre>MessageNotUnderstood: receiver of &quot;new&quot; is nil</pre>\n<p>\nWe should be able to parse malformed elements as well. \nLets see if the <code>push</code>, <code>match</code>, <code>pop</code> magic works, as expected:\n</p>\n<pre>MessageNotUnderstood: receiver of &quot;new&quot; is nil</pre>\n</section><section>\n<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>\nSo far it looks good. \nBut our tests are telling us only that element can parse the given input, it does not tell us how it parses the input. \nWe should assert that the proper element names and the right content is extracted. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt is the time to return a more convenient representation of the input: <em>an abstract syntax tree</em>.\nWe will do this in the <a href=\"AST.html\">following chapter</a>.\n\n</p></section></section>","title":"Parsing with PetitParser2","Author":"Jan Kurs"}
