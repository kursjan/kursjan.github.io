<h1>Optimizations Overview</h1>

<p class="note">Please note that the <code>WebGrammar</code> you could download in the <a href="AST.html">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> chapter contains already optimized version of an <code>element</code> rule. In this chapter we suppose that <code>element</code> definition looks like defined in <a href="chapter3.html">Extracting the Structure</a> chapter, i.e. it looks like this:</p><figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">WebGrammar&gt;&gt;element
	^ (elOpen, elContent, elClose)</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<section>
<h2>1. Basic Analysis</h2>
<p>
When running the <code>testStructuredDocument</code>, you might have noticed that the performance is not good. 
It is actually terribly bad. Let us inspect in in detail:
</p>
<figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">input := PP2Sources current htmlSample.
WebParser new debug: input.</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<section>
<h3>Report View</h3>
<p>
This will run the parser in a debug mode and collect a lot of useful information. Unfortunately, it also takes considerable amount of time so be patient. Once you get the result, inspect the <em>Report tab</em> (note that numbers might slightly differ in your case):
</p>
<p>

<figure>
	<img src="figures/unoptimized-report.png" width="100%%"/>
	<figcaption>Report view of non-optimized parse</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
The total stream size is 1171 characters. 
The parser has remembered the full context 510197 times and restored 387667 times. 
This means that the full copy of the context (including the stack of opened elements, which we use to match open and close tags) has been created 510197 times and the context has been restored from this full copy (by doing another copy) 387667 times. 
This is in average 331 backtrackings per consumed character. 
</p>

<p>
Some of the parsers do not need to perform the full context copy. 
These are prefixed with ‘lightweight’. 
In the lightweight case, only the position is remembered and restored (which is much faster than the full copy of a stack). 
This happened in average 92 times per character.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, these numbers are brutal. 
In ideal case, the number of full restores should be zero. 
Full remember and restore is very expensive. 
Very often only lightweight remember and restore happens, since many grammars are context-free, i.e. they do not use <code>push</code>, <code>match</code> and <code>pop</code> operators. 
</p>
<p>
Regarding the lightweight backtracking, the average of lightweight backtracks per character should be below 1 (in ideal case). 
This is also not so unusual case when dealing with deterministic grammars, which do not do any (or only a little) speculations and know exactly which alternative of a choice is the correct one. 
</p>
</section><section>
<h3>Debug View</h3>
<p>
But our grammar is obviously not deterministic it does lots of speculations.
Why are the numbers so bad in our case? 
Let us inspect in more detail how this was happening, using the <em>Debug view</em>:
</p>
<p>
<a id="unoptimizedDebug"></a>
<figure>
	<img src="figures/unoptimized-debug.png" width="100%%"/>
	<figcaption>0.1. Debug View of non-optimized parse.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
The view in Figure <a href="#unoptimizedDebug">0.1</a> shows that 1502165 parsers were invoked to consume the input. 
Most of it (751559 invocations) happened when parsing first two lines of the input --- the before water of the sea.
</p>
<p>
This is too much for a short input. 
Such a bad performance is caused by the fact that bounded seas have to verify at every position if the next parser (i.e. the parser that will be invoked after the sea) will succeed. 
If the next parser happens to be another sea (as in the case of <code>WebGrammar</code>), the number of invocations grows really fast (exponentially in fact). 
</p>

<p>
We see that the element rule took approximately one half of the invocations (750598). 
Majority of 751559 invocations of before water were spent by testing for element. 
</p>
<p>
Another glimpse of ineffectiveness can be seen in the <code>elOpen</code> rule in Figure <a href="#elOpenUnoptimized">0.2</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="elOpenUnoptimized"></a>
<figure>
	<img src="figures/unoptimized-elOpen.png" width="100%%"/>
	<figcaption>0.2. Debug view of the <code>elOpen</code> rule non-optimized parse.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
The whole <em>&lt;html lang=&quot;html&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; class=&quot;js-enabled&quot;&gt;</em> is parsed by invoking 272 parsers.
This is quite a lot for a line with 55 characters.
One of the reasons is how are the identifiers (<code>elementName</code>) parsed.
You can see that when recognizing the <em>html</em> text, 8 different parsers are invoked; for each letter one and some extra boilerplate parsers (flattening, possessive repeating,...).
</p>
</section></section><section>
<h2>2. Using the <code>optimize</code> method</h2>
<p>
Luckily, PetitParser2 comes with an automated optimizations that are able to reduce most of the unnecessary overhead. 
Let it give a try:
</p>
<figure><pre><code class="smalltalk">WebParser new optimize debug: input.</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>
The report looks much better now:
<a id=""></a>
<figure>
	<img src="figures/optimized-report.png" width="100%%"/>
	<figcaption>0.3. Report view of the optimized parse.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>


<p>
Only one full remember, and only 7 lightweight backtracks per character. 
This is reasonably good for a grammar with bounded seas. 
</p>
<p class="note">Because of the nature of bounded seas and nature of PetitParser2, we do not recommend to parse grammars with more complicated bounded seas without optimizations.</p>
<section>
<h3>Optimization in Detail</h3>
<p>
Let us inspect some of the optimizations that happened. 
We switch to <em>Debug view</em>:
</p>
<p>
<a id="optimizedDebug"></a>
<figure>
	<img src="figures/optimized-debug.png" width="100%%"/>
	<figcaption>0.4. Debug view of optimized parse</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
The Figure <a href="#optimizedDebug">0.4</a> shows that the total number of invoked parsers is 55144, roughly 30x less. 
We also see that, as in the previous case, most of the parsers are invoked in the before-water of the initial sea, but it is roughly 10x better now. 
We can also notice that the following island and after water are parsed using only 2 and 4 parser invocations respectively.
This is great, it was half of the total invocations in the case of unoptimized parse!
</p>
</section><section>
<h3>Caches</h3>

<p>
The main reason of reduced invocations is caching. 
Under the <code>element</code> rule in Figure <a href="#optimizedDebug">0.4</a>, there is a mapping node. 
The mapping node returns the complete HTML element just in one single invocation. 
The fact that the result has been cached is visualized via the result reference (see <code>DebugResultLink: reference</code>). 
</p>

<p>
The reference indicates that at the time of the invocation the result has already been computed during some previous invocation. 
The parser remembered the result and returned the remembered without invoking the parser again. 
There is another mapping node as a child of the reference with 54746 underlying invocations.
But as mentioned these have happened before and mapping node shows them just for the convenience.
</p>
<p>
The caching is done by the <code>PP2Cache</code> strategy (you can see its profiling version <code>PP2ProfilingCache</code> in the screenshot). 
The cache has been added to the element during the optimization phase. 
</p>
<p>
More about caches can be found in the <a href="caches.html">Caching chapter</a>.
</p>

</section><section>
<h3>Specializations</h3>

<p>
Another optimizations applied by PetitParser two are specializations.
The way specializations work can be demonstrated on the opening of an html element: <em>&lt;html lang=&quot;mul&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; class=&quot;js-enabled&quot;&gt;</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="elOpenOptimized"></a>
<figure>
	<img src="figures/optimized-elOpen.png" width="100%%"/>
	<figcaption>0.5. Debug view of the <code>elOpen</code> rule optimized parse</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
One can see that the <em>html</em> text has been recognized using only three invocation contrary to the eight invocations in the unoptimized case (see Figure <a href="#elOpenUnoptimized">0.2</a>).
In the unoptimized case the <em>html</em> text was parsed using the <em>PossessiveRepeating</em> strategy.
In the optimized case (see Figure <a href="#elOpenOptimized">0.5</a>) the used strategy is <em>PlusPredicateObject</em>, which is implemented as a while loop without superfluous parser invocations hence is more efficient.
</p>
<p>
The same thing happened with the mapping node. 
The specializations recognized an <em>any-star-lazy</em> pattern, which, in this case, means to consume any character until end of the tag <code>&gt;</code> appears.
This can be implemented as a single while loop saving 252 parser invocations.
</p>
<p class="todo">More details about specializations are provided in the <a href="smalltalkOptimizations.html">Smalltalk Parser</a> chapter.</p>

<h2>3. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Overall, PEG-based parser combinator parsers are great, they are easy to understand, easy to extend and easy to debug.
But this all comes at the price of inefficiency. 
Yet, the optimization capabilities of PetitParser can dramatically improve the performance while preserving all the other advantages.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, not all the optimizations can be done automatically.
There is one kind of optimizations that has to be done manually and we dedicate a whole <a href="memoization.html">Memoization</a> chapter to it.
