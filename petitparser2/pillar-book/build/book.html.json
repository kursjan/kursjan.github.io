{"content":"\n<p>\nIn this tutorial we describe how to quickly build a parser to extract a javascript code from any HTML source.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe show how can we utilize bounded seas - a tool that allows us to focus on the interesting parts of an input (i.e. javascript in our case) and ignore the rest (the remaining HTML code) to\nsave time and obtain results as fast as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe also describe performance optimizations abilities of PetitParser, that will allow us to generate high-performance parsers from our grammars that have performance comarable to table-driven parsers such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ThierryGoubier/SmaCC\">SmaCC</a> or hand-written parsers such as RBParser. \n</p><p class=\"todo\">add some graphs?</p>\n<p class=\"todo\">what about streaming capabilities?</p>\n<section>\n<h3>Structure</h3>\n<p>\nIn <a href=\"Chapters/chapter1.html\">Extracting Javascript</a> we start with a simple script.\nLater in <a href=\"Chapters/chapter2.html\">Real Grammar</a>, we turn the script into a proper grammar and add tests.\nIn <a href=\"Chapters/chapter3.html\">Extracting Structure</a>, we extend the parser to extract an html structure and we add tolerance for malformed documents.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn <a href=\"Chapters/chapter4.html\">Optimizations</a> we inspect optimizations capabilities of PetitParser2\nand in <a href=\"Chapters/chapter5.html\">Memoizations</a> we describe tooling of PetitParser2 that will help us to pinpoint the perofrmance bottlenecks and we show some techniques how to fix them.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn TODO we describe how to use the parser to do syntax highlighting.\n</p><p class=\"todo\">create a chapter</p>\n\n\n</section>","title":"PetitParser2 and Bounded Seas","Author":"Jan Kurs"}
