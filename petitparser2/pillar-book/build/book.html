        <div class="attribution"></div>

        
<p>
In this series we describe <a href="https://github.com/kursjan/petitparser2">PetitParser2</a> --- a modular and flexible high-performance top-down parsing framework.
</p>
<p class="note">Please note the text is not yet complete.</p><p>
 
This series is organized in two parts: 
</p>
<section>
<h3>Part I, Basics</h3>
<p>
In the first part, basics, we demonstrate how to quickly build a high-performance parser on the concrete example of extracting a Javascript code from any HTML source.
</p>
<p>
We start from prototyping in a playground until we reach a full-fledged and well-tested parser. 
We will utilize bounded seas --- a tool that allows a programmer to focus on the interesting parts of an input (i.e. Javascript in our case) and ignore the rest (the remaining HTML code).
We will use optimizations capabilities of PetitParser2 to turn our prototype into a production-ready parser. 
</p>

</section><section>
<h3>Part II, Advanced Topics</h3>
<p>
In the second part we describe advanced topics such as context-sensitive parsing, optimizations with caches and parser specializations, streaming capabilities or efficient highlighting of a text, when PetitParser is capable of continuous re-parsing of the whole input with every keystroke.
</p>
<p>
On a concrete example of a Smalltalk grammar, we describe how to develop a high-performance parser comparable to a table-driven such as <a href="https://github.com/ThierryGoubier/SmaCC">SmaCC</a> or hand-written parsers such as RBParser.

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>
The text is divided into two parts, the first part covers basics of PetitParser and is suitable for anyone who would like to start with PetitParser.
The second part covers advanced topics and is for those who already use PetitParser and who would like to better understand its internals or extend PetitParser to their needs.
</p>
</section><section>
<h3>Part I, Basics</h3>
<p>
In <a href="Chapters/chapter1.html">Extracting Javascript</a> we start with a simple script.
Later in <a href="Chapters/chapter2.html">Real Grammar</a>, we turn the script into a proper grammar and add tests.
In <a href="Chapters/chapter3.html">Extracting Structure</a> and <a href="Chapters/AST.html">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, we extend the parser to extract an HTML structure and we add tolerance for malformed documents.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="Chapters/optimizations.html">Optimizations</a> we inspect optimizations capabilities of PetitParser2
and in <a href="Chapters/memoization.html">Memoizations</a> we describe tooling of PetitParser2 that will help us to pinpoint the perofrmance bottlenecks and we show some techniques how to fix them.
